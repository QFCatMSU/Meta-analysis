The repository contains the following files:

**Ha_I2_XXXX_YYYY.R**: R code files for comparing precision between various methods (indicated in the file name by YYYY) and the inverse variance weighted analysis in random effects or hierarchical models (indicated in the file name by XXXX);

**missing_XXXX_YYYY**: R code files for comparing precision between various methods (indicated in the file name by YYYY) and the inverse variance weighted analysis in random effects or hierarchical models (indicated in the file name by XXXX) under various proportion of studies without complete information for calculation of within-study variance. These analyses were eventually used to idenfity the threshold proportion of missing within-study variance above which weighted analysis using complete cases are less precise.
